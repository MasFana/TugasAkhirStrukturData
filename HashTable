In Python, a dict (short for dictionary) is implemented as a hash and Hash Table. 

    Hashing the Key:

        When you access a key in a dictionary, Python computes the hash value of the key using the hash() function.
        This hash value is a numerical representation of the key and is used to determine where the value associated with the key is stored in the hash table.

    Index Calculation:

        Python maps the hash value to an index in an internal array (the hash table). This mapping ensures that each hash value corresponds to a unique bucket (or slot) in the table.

    Key Matching:

        Python checks the bucket corresponding to the computed index. If multiple keys collide (have the same hash or index), Python performs a linear search or other collision resolution to find the exact key.

        To verify the correct key, Python compares the queried key with keys in the bucket using the __eq__ method.

    Return the Value:

        Once the correct key is found, Python retrieves and returns the associated value from the bucket.


Key Points:

    Hashable Keys:

        Keys must be immutable (like strings, numbers, tuples) because the hash value of a key must not change during its lifetime in the dictionary.
    
    Performance:

        Key lookup in a dict is O(1) on average because hashing and array indexing are fast. However, in the case of many hash collisions, it can degrade to O(n).

    Collision Handling:

        Python handles collisions (multiple keys with the same hash) using a technique called open addressing or similar.

Hash Table:

    Definition: An abstract data type that implements an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values.

    Key-Value Pair: Stores key-value pairs and uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

    Thread-Safety: Generally not thread-safe. Synchronization is required to make operations thread-safe.

    Collision Handling: Uses techniques like chaining (where each bucket's slot contains a list of items) or open addressing (where collisions are resolved by probing).

Hash Map:

    Definition: A specific implementation of the hash table. It's a collection type that maps keys to values.

    Languages: Frequently used in object-oriented languages such as Java (HashMap), Python (dict), and C++ (unordered_map).

    Thread-Safety: Not thread-safe by default. For Java, ConcurrentHashMap is used for a thread-safe version.

    Collision Handling: Typically handled using chaining or open addressing, similar to hash tables.
